    }
    Let us suppose that this is the data available in the employee database. Now we will use RESTful APIs
    and endpoints to render or manipulate the data.

    Let's take the root-endpoint for the organisation to be "api.organisation.com"
    So to access all the employees data we will use the following path: api.organisation.com/v3/employees
    To access a particular employee: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}
    
    1. Creation of a new employee by HR:
    Method: POST
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees
    Command: POST /v3/employees
    Content type: application/json

    POST request is used to create a new resource on a server. This will create an entry for a new employee

    Request body: 
    {
        "employeeId": 3,
        "firstName": "Tim",
        "lastName": "Hammer",
        "mobileNumber": 1929757890,
        "dateOfJoining": "07-09-2018",
        "projects": [
            {
                "projectId": 5,
                "startingDateOfProject": "05-11-2018",
                "employeeRole": "Graphic Engineer"
            },
            {
                "projectId": 6,
                "startingDateOfProject": "06-01-2019",
                "employeeRole": "AI developer"
            }
        ]
    }
    This will enter the required information regarding the new employee and add it to the server.

    2. To get list of all employees: 
    Method: GET
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees
    Command: GET /v3/employees
    Content type: application/json

    GET request is used to get a resource from a server. 
    As this is a GET request there will be no requirement for the request body.
    //This will fetch and print the information of all the employees

    3. To get information of a particular employee: 
    Method: GET
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}
    Command: GET /v3/employees/id/1
    //This will fetch and print the information of the employee with id=1
    Output:
    {
        "employees": [
            {
                "employeeId": 1,
                "firstName": "Nikhil",
                "lastName": "Sharma",
                "mobileNumber": 1324657890,
                "dateOfJoining": "02-02-2002",
                "projects": [
                    {
                        "projectId": 1,
                        "startingDateOfProject": "03-05-2002",
                        "employeeRole": "Frontend Developer"
                    },
                    {
                        "projectId": 2,
                        "startingDateOfProject": "05-09-2002",
                        "employeeRole": "UI Developer"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    4. Update some data of an employee
    Methood: PUT
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}
    Command: PUT /v3/employee/id/2

    PUT request is used to update a resource on a server for the selected employee.
    Request body: 
    {
        "firstName": "Lee"
    }
    //Now the first name of employee #2 is Lee, not Ben
    This will update the firstName of employee with id=2 and replace it with "Lee"

    5. Select all projects assigned to an employee: 
    METHOD: GET
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}/projects
    Command: GET /v3/employees/id/3/projects

    //This will fetch the information regarding the projects of the employee with id=3
    {
        "projects": [
            {
                "projectId": 5,
                "startingDateOfProject": "05-11-2018",
                "employeeRole": "Graphic Engineer"
            },
            {
                "projectId": 6,
                "startingDateOfProject": "06-01-2019",
                "employeeRole": "AI developer"
            }
        ]
    }

    6. Assign project(s) to an employee by HR:
    Method: POST
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}/projects
    Command: POST /v3/employees/id/3/projects
    Content type: application/json
    Request body: 
    {
        "projectId": 7,
        "startingDateOfProject": "09-02-2019",
        "employeeRole": "Graphic Engineer"
    }
    This will add another project with "projectID": 7 to employee with "employeeID": 3.
    //Now there are 3 projects for employee #3

    7. Edit project information by the HR: 
    Method: PUT
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}/projects
    Command: PUT /v3/employees/id/3/projects
    Content type: application/json
    Request body: 
    {
        "projectId": 7,
        "startingDateOfProject": "09-02-2019",
        "employeeRole": "Graphic Designer"
    }
    //Now the role of employee #3 in project #7 is changed from "Graphic Engineer" to "Graphic Designer".

    8. Select a project by the employee: 
    Method: PUT
    Endpoint: api.organisation.com/v3/employees/id/{employeeId}
    Command: PUT /v3/employees/3
    Content type: application/json
    Request body: 
    {
        "activeProject": 7
    }
    //This implies that employee #3 is currently working on project #7.
